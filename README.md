# python-todo-app

A simple CLI based Todo app made in Python

This is my first python program. I want to take on the challenge to create something like this in python based on my knowledge in other programming languages like C++ and JavaScript.
Therefore, this app is a pretty simple app without much going on.

## Features
1. View Todo List
2. Add New Items
3. Remove Items
4. Clear List
5. Saves list to file (persistent)

## How to run

To run this app, you need Python installed. If you don't have it installed already, you can download it from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
After that,
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/thisismalindu/python-todo-app.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```
   cd python-todo-app
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   ```
   python todo.py
   ```
   
The application will start, and you can follow the on-screen menu to perform various tasks with your todo list.

The code is well organized and should be easy to read through and understand.
